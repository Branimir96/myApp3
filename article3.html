            <h2>CO2 in Room</h2>
            <p class="article-date">Published: September 2, 2024</p>
            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can significantly impact sleep quality, particularly in poorly ventilated indoor environments. CO2 is naturally exhaled by humans, and when confined spaces lack proper air circulation, CO2 concentrations can rise. Elevated CO2 levels during sleep have been shown to affect breathing patterns and overall sleep efficiency.

                Research suggests that high concentrations of CO2 can cause disturbances in sleep architecture, such as reduced deep sleep stages, which are crucial for physical recovery and mental well-being. When CO2 levels increase, the brain’s response is to regulate breathing more intensively to expel the excess gas, which can lead to more fragmented sleep and frequent awakenings throughout the night.
                
                Additionally, excessive CO2 can reduce oxygen intake, leading to symptoms like headaches, increased heart rate, and feelings of restlessness upon waking. Cognitive function may also be affected, resulting in difficulty concentrating and diminished productivity during the day. Poor ventilation in bedrooms, particularly in energy-efficient, tightly sealed buildings, is a major factor contributing to elevated indoor CO2 levels.
                
                To improve sleep quality, it’s essential to ensure proper ventilation in sleeping environments by opening windows or using air purifiers to maintain healthy CO2 levels. This simple change can help support better, more restorative sleep and overall health.</p>
